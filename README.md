# FFXIV 
This contains code relevant to dev work I've done for FFXIV or FFXIV adjacent purposes. Currently there is:
* Mini-cactpot solver: Uses expected value heuristics to attempt to optimally solve mini-cactpot. INCOMPLETE. Still missing human interface for solving aide, but runs and averages ~1050 mgp/play. Untested on real boards though.
